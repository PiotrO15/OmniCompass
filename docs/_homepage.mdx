## ðŸ“– Introduction

**OmniCompass** is a mod which adds compasses capable of finding biomes and structures. By default, it includes a Biome Compass and a Structure Compass, each able to point to any biome or structure. You can also create custom compasses using data packs.

## ðŸ§­ OmniCompass Capabilities

OmniCompass data pack format allows you to create new compasses, which includes:
- Selecting specific biomes or structures that can be found
- Access restrictions based on player advancements
- Custom renderers, allowing you to change the look of a compass with just a single texture

If the existing system doesnâ€™t support your use case, make sure to open an issue on Github or to join the Discord and share your suggestions!

## âœ¨ Creating a Custom Compass

### Prerequisites

Creating custom compasses requires both data and resource packs. Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Text editor with JSON highlighting, such as Visual Studio Code
- Basic understanding of the JSON syntax
- Basic knowledge of [data pack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) and [resource pack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack) formats

### Getting Started

Creating a custom compass includes the following three elements:
1. [Compass definition](./custom-compasses/datapack-format) (data pack), which specifies your compass's behavior.
2. [Compass assets](./custom-compasses/resourcepack-format) (resource pack): the model and the translated name of the compass.
3. [Recipe](./custom-compasses/compass-recipes) (data pack), which will be used to obtain the compass.
