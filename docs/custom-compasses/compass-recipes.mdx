# Compass Recipes

Compasses you add aren't actually new items. Instead, compass type is stored in a data component.

<Callout variant="warning">
    This means that recipes for inexistent compasses will still work and display in recipe viewers.

## Simple Shaped Compass Recipe

Compass recipes use a `components` object to set `omnicompass:compass_type` to the right compass type.

The following recipe uses a compass and planks and creates a biome compass as a result.
```json
{
  "type": "minecraft:crafting_shaped",
  "category": "equipment",
  "key": {
    "C": {
      "item": "minecraft:compass"
    },
    "S": {
      "tag": "minecraft:planks"
    }
  },
  "pattern": [
    " S ",
    "SCS",
    " S "
  ],
  "result": {
    "components": {
      "omnicompass:compass_type": "minecraft:biome"
    },
    "count": 1,
    "id": "omnicompass:compass"
  }
}
```
